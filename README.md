# Performance-Estimation
Open Source Performance Estimation code and dataset.

This repository is the open source code and dataset of Performance Estimation by Alibaba.

The dataset is collected from real industrial scenarios (Taobao Platform), covering about 5,000,000 ads over a month (31 days) with a data size of about 50 GB (150 million logs), each log contains bids, performance and 96 possible features used (including, pv, click, trade count, trade amount, category, good rate, shop star level, industry, etc.).

Our dataset is a commercial data obtained from Taobao platform, which requires a strict desensitization process that requires considerable time and approval.

The code is a T^2CL model based on causal inference and has been submitted to KDD 2023.

We will release this desensitized large-scale public dataset and code after the paper is accepted.
